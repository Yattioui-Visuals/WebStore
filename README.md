# WebStore
Hi , here is the repo of the project I worked on over the weekend. However I would like to let you know I didn't have full time invested because of some stuff happenning
in my private life. All that being said, I never build an API before nor did I work with the rest framework. I really enjoyed learning about it and putting it in my own project.
Some fields I could've polished some more, and defintly could have added a nice frontend to the webstore. 

Stuff I would've liked to polish more was my models and tests , and my authentications. With that being said I did learn a lot while working on this project.
I really am looking forward what you will say about it, and hopefully get to learn from that aswell! I will continue on this project to learn the rest framework more.

I hope I have displayed my skills and learning abilities well in this project and in this file and I am looking forward to our next meeting!
